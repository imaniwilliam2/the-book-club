# The Book Club

## Overview

"That's the thing about books. They let you travel without moving your feet." Said by Jhumpa Lahiri in The Namesake. The Book Club is the perfect outlet to not only travel through dimensions of remarkable literature, but to also do that with others. Reading is fun as is but whne you are able to share that experiece with another it opens to a whole new world of possibilities. The Book Club allows your to browse books, authors, and genres all while chatting with others apart of the club.
